### Hannah White 30.04.2020

Uses stability metrics for plant productivity calculated using code in StabilityMetrics repository: variability, resistance, 
recovery time, and recovery rate. These are modelled in three sets of hectads: pasture, heterogeneous, and all. Model code is 
found in GLS_XREFIT2.R

Code for graphics of results are found in XCoeffREFIT2.R

Landscape heterogeneity is calculated in Shannon_moore.R
Preparation of E-OBS climate data is found in Eobs_nearneigh0_1deg.R

SEM code for analyses in climate is found in SEMclimate.R

aggregate10.R aggregates MODIS EVI data to 10 x 10 km square scale.
